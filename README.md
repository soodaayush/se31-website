## Purpose

SE31 Nest is an open-source, unofficial home for the University of Waterloo Software Engineering Class of 2031. It brings together:
- A public landing page for the cohort.
- A source-linked record of important dates and trusted Waterloo links.
- A skimmable guide to the six 1A courses, based on archived outlines.
- A clearly labelled planning draft that always points students back to their official Quest schedule.
- A shared cohort home that students can improve as we grow.
